*  0.1.04
  * added a few new shortcodes; _`icon`_, _`lead`_ and _`blockquote`_
  * dropped `.pager` class, needed to re-write page navigation to use button classes
  * changed `.pagination` class functionality required rewrite of pagination
  * changed `.input-group`&gt;`.input-group-addon` functionality required small changes to search and comment forms.
  * renamed `.label` class to `.tag`, this causes all of WP's *"tag taxonomy"* to break - needed to write filters to remove WP behavior.
    * e.g. if you have a tag called __success__ then WP inserts a class called `tag-success`, this causes the whole article to show as a BS4 tag.
  * needed to revert to using &lt;center&gt; html - just can't seem to figure out CSS centering
  * small changes to footer area
