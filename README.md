Introduction
------------

A responsive Wordpress blogging theme based on [Bootstrap 4](http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com).

Unlike [WP-Bootstrap2](https://github.com/vinorodrigues/wp-bootstrap2) that started with *_S*, this project written from the ground up to cut out a lot of clutter.

This implies certain considerations:
* The theme is not multi-language, no l10n (localization) exists.  It's only in English.
* RTL (right-to-left language) is also excluded
* Common class names used in WP Core have been removed. As few non-Bootstrap class names as possible is the approach taken.
* Assistive technologies are excluded in this initial release.  This will be updated later.
